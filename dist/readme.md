My original intention was to create a simple example of Thailand map using d3.js. Then I got a bit too excited and added some effects. 

* Each province is color-coded by the length of its name in English. 
* Hover each province to see text effects.
* New font is chosen randomly every time you change the province. 
* Click on a province to zoom in. Click somewhere else to zoom out.
